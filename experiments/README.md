## Experiments

This section contains code for experiments in the paper. They also serve as examples on how to use and extend MEB.

Results and code are shared in a jupyter notebook. The notebooks can be viewed directly from github or they can be opened and modified using jupyter notebook.

[Benchmarks](Benchmarks) contains notebooks with results and code to reimplement from Tables 7 and 8.

[paper_experiments](paper_experiments) contains notebooks with results and code to reimplement other tables and figures in the paper.

[minimal_example.py](minimal_example.py) is a python file with minimal use of MEB to showcase the protocol in use without the complexity of (also without the ease of use) of a library.
