## Experiments

This section contains code for experiments in the paper. They also serve as examples on how to use and extend MEB.

Results and code are shared in a jupyter notebook. The notebooks can be viewed directly from github or they can be opened and modified using jupyter notebook.

[Benchmarks](Benchmarks) contains notebooks with results and code to reimplement from Tables 7 and 8.

[paper_experiments](paper_experiments) contains notebooks with results and code to reimplement other tables and figures in the paper.

[minimal_example.py](minimal_example.py) is a python file with minimal use of MEB to showcase the protocol in use without the complexity of (also without the ease of use) of a library.

[evaluate.py](evaluate.py) is a python script that accepts command line arguments for the use of MEB.

## How to start with my own implementation?
You can start by viewing related notebooks. Once you find one that closely resembles your implementation, you can copy the notebook and start modifying the code.
